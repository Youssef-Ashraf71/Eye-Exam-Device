# Eye-Exam-Device

## Device Description

A device that does eye examination to measure sight acuity.
This device consists of 6 points placed circularly around the  center point of the board and the patient will be given a hand
laser and will be asked to:
1. Move a certain distance away from the board
2. Aim at certain points on the mirror so the patient can hit targets on the board behind him/her.
After the examination the board will calculate the percentage of hits with respect to the while test targets (%) and this
percentage will represent a **new eye sharpness scale** to indicate how well the patient’s visual acuity is.


## Electronic Design Section:

Our aim was to reduce the cost and boost the clearness of the diagram/model so we made it on a small scale on a circular shape also it can be implemented on a larger scale depending on the usability.
